"""
This file is used to:
1. Define helper functions used in test_app.py and other test files.
2. Configure shared setup or utilities required across multiple test files.
3. Import commonly used modules or functions to avoid repetitive imports in individual test files.

Guidelines:
- Use this file sparingly for shared resources that are truly needed by multiple tests.
- For fixtures or configurations, consider using `conftest.py` in the tests directory.
- Avoid cluttering this file with test-specific logic; keep it general and reusable.

Examples of what to include:
- Helper functions or classes.
- Shared constants for testing.
- Common imports that all tests rely on.

Examples of what NOT to include:
- Test cases themselves (these belong in individual test files).
- Project-specific logic that isn't directly relevant to testing.

### Requirements  

- **Gradescope Access**: Teaching Assistant or Instructor role on a CS10 Gradescope course instance.  
- **Google Cloud Project**: Configured for Google Sheets API access. 


### 1. Environment Setup

- Store Gradescope credentials in environment variables `GRADESCOPE_EMAIL` and `GRADESCOPE_PASSWORD`. Define these in a `.env` file.
- If you do not have a password setup on Gradescope, you will need to create a password.
- There should be three variables total in the `.env` file. Follow step 2 to add the `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS` variable.


### 2. Google Authentication Setup

1. **Create a New Project in Google Cloud Console**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - In the top-left corner, create a new project.

2. **Enable Google Sheets API**
   - Select your project and navigate to **APIs & Services**.
   - Go to the **Library** tab and search for "Google Sheets API".
   - Click on **Google Sheets API** and enable it.

3. **Create a Service Account**
   - Go to the **Credentials** tab within **APIs & Services**.
   - Fill out the fields as necessary to create a new service account.
   - No additional roles are required at this stage.

4. **Share Google Sheets Access**
   - Under the **Service Accounts** section on the **Credentials** page, click on the account email.
   - Share the Google Sheet with this email address to give access.
   - If this step is skipped, you will get a 403 Access Forbidden error when writing to Google Sheets.

5. **Generate JSON Key**
   - Navigate to the **Keys** section of the service account.
   - Click **Add Key** and create a JSON key.
   - This will download a key file to your computer.

6. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in this directory (if it doesn’t already exist).
   - Add the following line to the `.env` file:
     ```plaintext
     SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS=<contents-of-downloaded-keyfile>
     ```
   - Example:
    ```plaintext
    SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id","private_key_id":"your-private-key-id","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\nMIIEvAIBADANBgkq...\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\n","client_email":"your-service-account-email@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com","client_id":"your-client-id","auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs","client_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/your-service-account-email%40your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"}
    ```

### 3. Define a config file to define constraints

1. **Create a new config file**: Navigate into the folder `gradescopeCronJob/config/`, and create a new config file with the naming scheme `{class}_{semester, year}.json`. For example, the file could be named `cs10_fall2024.json`. 

2. **Define the necessary constraints**:
   - **GRADESCOPE_COURSE_ID**: The course ID is the final component of the URL on the Gradescope course homepage: `https://www.gradescope.com/courses/[GRADESCOPE_COURSE_ID]`
   
   - **PL_COURSE_ID**: The course ID is the component of the URL following course_instance. For example: `https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/[PL_COURSE_ID]/instructor/instance_admin/access`

   - **SCOPES**: This should not be modified by the user. Use `"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets"` to allow write access.

   - **SPREADSHEET_ID**: The spreadsheet ID is the final component of the spreadsheet’s URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[SPREADSHEET_ID]/edit?gid=0#gid=0`

   - **NUMBER_OF_STUDENTS**: Please enter a number **greater than** the total number of students, to account for late adds. There is no harm in choosing a NUMBER_OF_STUDENTS greater than the actual number.

# 4. Set up the spreadsheet
- Make a copy of the following template sheet: 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V77ApZbfwLXGGorUaOMyWrSyydz_X1FCJb7MLIgLCSw/edit?gid=0#gid=0

# 5. Docker Container

#### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system.

## Build and Run the Docker Container



### Step 1: Build the Docker Image

In this directory, run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t gradescope-cron-job --build-arg PORT=8080 .
```

This command will create a Docker image with the cron job configuration and necessary dependencies. This includes the `--build-arg PORT=8080` flag to specify the `$PORT` variable from the build arg flag.


### Step 2: Run the Docker Container

Once the image is built, start the container in detached mode:

```bash
docker run -d --name gradescope-cron-container --expose 8080 -e PORT=8080 gradescope-cron-job
```

This command will run the container in the background. This exposes the port 8080 and sets the environment variable `PORT=8080`, which is the port that the google cloud service runs on by default.


### Step 3: Monitor the Logs

To view the cron job output, check the container logs. Use the following command to follow the logs in real-time:

```bash
docker logs -f gradescope-cron-container
```

Replace `gradescope-cron-job` with the actual container ID if needed. This command will display live logs, allowing you to monitor the cron job's execution.

### Example Log Command with Container ID

Alternatively, if you know the container ID, you can run:

```bash
docker logs -f e9b989ea03676f2141b1014891f436c7b3061320a479d8fa3231a4426c84d4c1
```
- e9b989ea03676f2141b1014891f436c7b3061320a479d8fa3231a4426c84d4c1 is an example to replace with the containerID.


## Configuration

- The cron job schedule and script configurations are set up within the Dockerfile and accompanying cron job files.
- Logs are stored in `/var/log/cron.log` within the container and are accessible through Docker logs as shown.

## Stopping the Container

To stop the running container:

```bash
docker stop gradescope-cron-container
```

## Removing the Container

If you wish to remove the container after stopping it:

```bash
docker rm gradescope-cron-container
```


## Troubleshooting

- **Container isn't starting**: Check Docker build output for errors during the image creation step.


## Deployment

### **Step 1: Build the Docker Container**
Build the Docker container from the `Dockerfile`:
```bash
docker build -t gradescope-cron-job .
```

### **Step 2: Check if the Docker Image Exists**
Verify that the image was built successfully:
```bash
docker image ls
```

### **Step 3: Run the Docker Container on Port 8080**
Run the container and map it to port 8080 (matching the cloud deployment setup):
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e PORT=8080 gradescope-cron-job
```
- `-p 8080:8080`: Maps the host's port 8080 to the container's port 8080
- `-e PORT=8080`: Ensures the container is aware of the port configuration

### **Step 4: Tag the Docker Container**
Tag the Docker container with the destination in Google Cloud Artifact Registry:
```bash
docker tag gradescope-cron-job us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/eecs-gradeview/gradescopecronjob/gradescope-cron-job
```

### **Step 5: Initialize Google Cloud and Authorize**
Set up Google Cloud CLI and authenticate:
```bash
gcloud init
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth configure-docker us-west2-docker.pkg.dev
```

### **Step 6: Push the Tagged Docker Container**
Push the Docker image to Google Cloud Artifact Registry:
```bash
docker push us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/eecs-gradeview/gradescopecronjob/gradescope-cron-job
```

## Additional Notes
### Cron Job
The cron job, located in ```cronjob``` is scheduled to run at the start of every hour, as indicated by 0 * * * *, meaning it executes at minute 0 of every hour, every day, and every month. It runs under the root user, ensuring it has the necessary permissions. The command being executed is timeout 300 /gradescopeCronJob/gradescope_to_spreadsheet.py, which runs the script while enforcing a maximum execution time of 300 seconds (5 minutes). If the script exceeds this limit, it will be forcibly terminated. This setup ensures the script runs automatically at regular intervals without exceeding the allowed runtime.
